                    <h1>All Star Code</h1>
                    <p>I had the privilege of participating in the All Star Code program in the summer of 2022. This program is unique in that 
                    it brings together high school students, specifically males of color, to learn about web development, entrepreneurship, 
                    and innovation in New York. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was held online this year. Despite this, 
                    the education provided was outstanding. Through the six-week program, I not only gained proficiency in web development,
                    but I also gained valuable insights into the real world through conversations with businesspeople of color who shared 
                    similar challenges with us. This really demonstrated to us that the tech industry is open to anyone who is willing to put in 
                    the effort. All Star Code also gives every team to make a project they are passionate about and present it in front of a
                    panel of judges and pottentially recive funding for their ideas. In addition to the summer program, All Star Code also 
                    offers a range of other resources and opportunities for us, such as mentorship, networking events, and 
                    job placements. The organization has fostered a supportive comminty.</p>

                    <h1>Cyber Patriot</h1>
                    <p>As the head captain of all three teams and captain of Team 3, I was responsible for overseeing and leading a group of cadets who were new to the field of cyber security. This required me to be a strong leader and mentor, as well as possess a deep understanding of cyber security concepts and techniques. I spent countless hours teaching cadets and preparing them for the competition, and I am proud to say that our hard work paid off. We performed exceptionally well in the semi-finals, securing a 3rd place finish against a highly competitive field of more than 1,500 schools nationwide.
                        My exceptional leadership and cyber security skills did not go unnoticed, as I was offered and accepted a $4,000 scholarship by the Department of Defense to the 8140 Baseline Cyber Security Certification Program at the SANS Institute. This program is highly respected within the field and is approved by the Department of Defense, making it a valuable opportunity for me to further my education and career in cyber security. I am grateful for the opportunity and excited to continue learning and growing as a cyber security professional.</p>

                    <h1>Cajun Navy Reliif</h1>
                    <p> As a member of the Aggie Coding Club, I was able to contribute my web development skills to a worthwhile cause by working on a website for Cajun Navy Relief, a non-profit organization that helps those in need, particularly during disasters. We created the entire website from scratch for free. It was a valuable learning experience for me, as I faced the pressure of meeting deadlines and maintaining company standards, and it was the largest project I had ever tackled. One of the biggest challenges we faced as a team was how to make the website lightweight so that it could be accessed even in low bandwidth and accessible for individuals with disabilities. These were new considerations for me, and I learned a lot from the experience. Currently, the organization is putting the finishing touches on the website and preparing to launch it. It has been a challenging and rewarding experience to work on this project, and I am proud to have contributed to Cajun Navy Relief's important mission of helping those in need.
