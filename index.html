                    <h1>All Star Code</h1>
                    <p>I had the privilege of participating in the All Star Code program in the summer of 2022. This program is unique in that 
                    it brings together high school students, specifically males of color, to learn about web development, entrepreneurship, 
                    and innovation in New York. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was held online this year. Despite this, 
                    the education provided was outstanding. Through the six-week program, I not only gained proficiency in web development,
                    but I also gained valuable insights into the real world through conversations with businesspeople of color who shared 
                    similar challenges with us. This really demonstrated to us that the tech industry is open to anyone who is willing to put in 
                    the effort. All Star Code also gives every team to make a project they are passionate about and present it in front of a
                    panel of judges and pottentially recive funding for their ideas. In addition to the summer program, All Star Code also 
                    offers a range of other resources and opportunities for us, such as mentorship, networking events, and 
                    job placements. The organization has fostered a supportive comminty.</p>
